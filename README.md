## Introduction

Millions of people hanger three time a day. Motorcycles are an exciting
development for delivering. They aim to make time saver and more
available food variety.
In this competition problem, weâ€™ll be looking at how a fleet of motorcycles
can efficiently get orders to their order makers in a simulated city.

## Task

Given a list of reserved orders in a city and a fleet of motorcycle, assign
the orders to motorcycles, so that order get to their order maker on time.
For every order that arrived on time (or early), you will earn points
proportional to the distance of that path; plus an additional bonus if the
motorcycle also started on time.
